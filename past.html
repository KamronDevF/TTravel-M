        <p><span id="darkf">Welcome to the Castle </span> A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders. Scholars usually consider a castle to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. <br>This is distinct from a mansion, palace, and villa, whose main purpose was exclusively for <br> pleasance and are not primarily fortresses but may be fortified.
